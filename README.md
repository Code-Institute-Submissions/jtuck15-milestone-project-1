>I built this website to showcase the talents of the greatest Rock and Roll band in the world, The Rolling Stones! It gives an insight into the band members, displays many different albums, has a sign up page for updates on the band, a bookings page for users to book the band for special occasions and also has a little taster of some their songs so you can listen to them. I have designed this website in such a way that is user friendly and easy on the eye.

## UX

The purpose of this project is to create a static **(front-end only)** website for a 1960â€™s rock band who have around 50 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world. The target audiences for this website are fans of the Rolling Stones and potential fans who would like to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.

**In order for the target audience to achieve these things when visiting my website, I incorporated the following:**
- Audio clips for visitors to listen to some of the bands songs
- Video files so the visitors can view the band performing
- A sign up page for the user to register, which would include information on new music releases, tours, ticket releases etc.
- Information about the band and it's members, to give the user an overview of their lives
- A bookings page so users can book the band for various events
- Social media links for users to follow to stay up to date with any news the band may have

>I have matched the design of the webpage to suit the colours associated with the band and also included logos and pictures throughout, to give a good overall user experience.
