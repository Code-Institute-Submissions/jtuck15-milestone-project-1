# The Rolling Stones

![alt text](https://github.com/jtuck15/milestone-project-1/blob/master/images/RollingStonesWebsite.PNG "Header Picture on the Homepage")

>I built this website to showcase the talents of the greatest Rock and Roll band in the world, The Rolling Stones! It gives an insight into the band members, displays many different albums, has a sign up page for updates on the band, a bookings page for users to book the band for special occasions and also has a little taster of some their songs so you can listen to them. I have designed this website in such a way that is user friendly and easy on the eye.

## UX

The purpose of this project is to create a static **(front-end only)** website for a 1960’s rock band who have around 50 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world. The target audiences for this website are fans of the Rolling Stones and potential fans who would like to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.

**In order for the target audience to achieve these things when visiting my website, I incorporated the following:**
- Audio clips for visitors to listen to some of the bands songs
- Video files so the visitors can view the band performing
- A sign up page for the user to register to receive information on new music releases, tours, ticket releases etc.
- Information about the band and it's members, to give the user an overview of their lives
- A bookings page so users can book the band for various events
- Social media links for users to follow to stay up to date with any news the band may have

>I have matched the design of the webpage to suit the colours associated with the band and also included logos and pictures throughout, to give a good overall user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - This was used as the layout to fully build the website

- **[JQuery](https://jquery.com/)** - This was used to add read more buttons within some of the pages and also used for the back to top button to add a smooth scroll and fade

## Testing

I have thoroughly tested this website and was unable to find any broken links within it. I have also tried to submit blank contact forms and forms with incorrect email addresses which gave me an error message on each field to show that the required attribute within my form is working as it should.

### Issues/Bugs
I had a major issue with a fixed background on iOS devices. I had images set up on my home page that were fixed when I scroll up and down and they looked good on every device except for iOS. It was like the image was zoomed in so far and stretched on both iPhones and iPads. I did a lot of research to try and fix this but to no avail. I found a couple of posts with suggestions for a fix, but it only worked for the whole background of the page and not just a section of the page.

I also had an issue with text-shadow on Samsung Galaxy S6 devices. When a user clicked on a certain page e.g. Home; the Home text would display with a shadow effect like a spotlight was shining on the words. It looked well on iPhones and Samsung Galaxy S8 but was quite distorted on the Galaxy 6 S6, which is why I removed it from mobile devices. It is still set up for tablets, laptops and desktops.

### Validation
All files passed validation testing at https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea

## Deployment
My website is currently deployed on Github Pages - https://jtuck15.github.io/milestone-project-1/

I was able to deploy the website here by going to my repository in which all the files are saved, clicking on settings at the top and scrolling down to the heading GitHub Pages. Underneath the heading there is a source and I chose master branch from the dropdown which allows you to host the website on GitHub Pages.

### Acknowledgements
- [Code Institute](https://www.codeinstitute.net/)
- Rohan Hapani - His smooth scroll design using JQuery on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/desirecode/pen/MJPJqV/) really helped me with my back to top button as I felt without the use of JQuery, it didn't look too appealing when you click the button and it jumps straight back to the top.
- Legendary - I took inspiration from this read more/read less button using JQuery on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/legendaryPower/pen/dvJQvB) as I felt that the sections on the band members page were very long on a mobile. This helped shorten the length and give the user the option to read more and also read less.
- [W3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modal_images.asp) - I used their modal description to add modal images to each of the band members pictures on the Band page.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/javascript/#carousel) - I used the carousel example on Bootstrap to set up my carousel of pictures on the Home page.
